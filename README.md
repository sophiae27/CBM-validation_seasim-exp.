### Data from a laboratory experiment used to validate the coral bleaching model, and the simulated model outputs

This respository contains data supporting a manuscript. 

The experimental environmental data and validation data (experimental_data.xlsx) and simulated outputs from the coral bleaching model (model_data) are available for download.
Simulated model outputs are .mat files, from the coral bleaching model - see coral-bleaching-model repository (https://github.com/sophiae27/coral-bleaching-model)
